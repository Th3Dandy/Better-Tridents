  What does it do :

Melee damage : 9->10

Ranged damage : 8->10

Attack speed (in game logic) : 1.1->1.3

Attack speed (in seconds, time between hits) : 0.9->0.75

With sharpness V :

Melee damage : +3=13

Ranged damage is unstable

NOTE : Tooltip damage, the one shown in your inventory, is broken. It won't fetch the real damage but rather the one of that item in the game code, from what I understood. So it will show 9, but deal the above values.
